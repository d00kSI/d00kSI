## üëã About Me

I am a dynamic and results-oriented leader with over 10 years of experience architecting innovative solutions across creative design, data curation/analysis, full-stack development, AI applications, localization, and project management. I have a proven ability to translate user-centric design into robust backend functionality and to lead international, multilingual teams in delivering high-impact projects.

My journey began with a strong foundation in print media and graphic design, evolving through a significant tenure in tech focusing on data curation and localization for a major US tech company (FAANG). I've since expanded into technical leadership, full-stack development, and am keenly developing my expertise in Data Analysis and AI. I'm passionate about leveraging technology to optimize processes, enhance user experiences, and drive impactful results.
